Joao: A website for education with user sign in and login
The front-end was made with SimpleHTTPRequestHandler directly, the user sign in and log in saves the user data in the database.
Is a modest project, mainly directed to the design of the pages, but the back-end logic, yet simple, is functional.
Some concepts were implemented like Python OOP and Database.
The files are connect and the code is clean and easy to follow.
I advice to upgrade the idea using some framework and add more features using API and JSON.

Python OOP:7/10
Modules: 7/10
Database:7/10
JSON/API:0/10
Overall: 6
